    RVC offers state of the art courses, with a commitment to landing students actual jobs. At RVC you can expect knowledgable professors that don't waste your time. The cost of learning at RVC is incredibly reasonable and affordable, the staff is passionate and guiding, and the courses are packed with content, all in a friendly community setting.     
    </p>
    
    <p>Everything seen on this page was programmed with the knowledge gained in just half of a semester, in a single course. Imagine what you can grasp with just a few classes at RVC! It doesn't end there though: RVC can help students transfer to a four year college, or find employment through their RVCJobs program. Here you can also earn certificates, or undergo certain specified training for specific careers.</p>
    
        <p><i>"Before enrolling in RVC, I really saw no possibility of a higher education, I felt like I had missed my chace. All of that changed when I enrolled in RVC's GED program. In just 8 weeks, I gained the knowledge to obtain my GED, and from there I got all the support and empowerment I needed to take the step into college. My family is low-income, yet RVC is giving me a real shot at getting into the career I want. Take it from the student writing this page: So far my first semester has been nothing but learning skills genuinely useful in the long term for my career."</i> - Maxwell Schonberg, RVC student. </p>
